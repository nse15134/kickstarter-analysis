#KickStarter-Analysis Challenge - Nick Emery

## Overview of Project
The overview of this project was to analyze global kickstarter data to be able to identify trends, patters, outliers and outcomes.
I performed a few different analyses on this data set from Mean and Medians to time series analysis as well as Standard deviation figures.

# Two Conclusions about Theatre by Launch Date
One of the key data points that jumps out to me is the sheer level of volume during the mid-year months.  Whether the resulted in Failed or Successful outcomes.
While the volume between Fail/Success is noticeable, the overall trend throughout the year is very similiar.  

#Conclusion on Outcomes based on Goals
One of the limitations based on this dataset is that it is only related to Plays, it is only analyzing a small sub-category of the data and not taking
into account the entire population.  The data also seems to inverse as the goals move higher.  Outcomes seems to be directly coorelated with The Goal Range.

#Other Possible Data Points/Visualizations
We can extend the Outcomes based on Goals into a seperate pivot table where the subcategory selection is not worked into the COUNTIFS statement, but as a filer into 
a visual that is dynamic on a pivot table.  Giving the end user full-freedom to slice and dice the data as they need.
